  <h2>About this website</h2>
  <p> This website was created with the purpose of creating a community were students can create an
  account and sell a product (new or used) and buy. It also allows the owner (account holder) to delete the
  product when its no more avaliable. We believe in unity and simplicity. Thats why we created this
  cross device website to make it easy to sell and buy.</p>
